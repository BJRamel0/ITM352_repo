Main Requirements
- Array (objects) displayitems and quantities avaliable
- Forms process information on server
- Allow users select and process multiple products/services

---------- Part A ----------

0. Directory 이름은 <your last name>_<your first name>_Assignment1
1. JSON (products.json)
    - Array objects
        name
        price
        image
        description
        qty_available
2. Server for application 
    - Products data,
    - displaying products page
    - valiating purchase data
    - invoice for purchase
    이름은 server.js
        // Importing the Express.js framework 
        const express = require('express');
        // Create an instance of the Express application called "app"
        // app will be used to define routes, handle requests, etc
        const app = express();

        // Monitor all requests regardless of their method (GET, POST, PUT, etc) and their path (URL)
        app.all('*', function (request, response, next) {
        console.log(request.method + ' to ' + request.path);
        next();
        });

        // Route all other GET requests to serve static files from a directory named "public"
        app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/public'));

        // Start the server; listen on port 8080 for incoming HTTP requests
        app.listen(8080, () => console.log(`listening on port 8080`));
3. products.json load into server.js
 - Code after app.all; before public route
    /* Import data from a JSON file containing information about products
    __dirname represents the directory of the current module (where server.js is located)
    __dirname + "./products.json" specifies the location of products.json
    */
    const products = require(__dirname + "./products.json");

    // Define a route for handling a GET request to a path that matches "./products.js"
    app.get('./products.js', function(request, response, next) {
        // Send the response as JS
        response.type('.js');
        
        // Create a JS string (products_str) that contains data loaded from the products.json file
        // Convert the JS string into a JSON string and embed it within variable products
        const products_str = `let products = ${JSON.stringify(products)};`;
        
        // Send the string in response to the GET request
	response.send(products_str);
    });
4. Client page (products_display.html and invoice.html)
    - GET request products.js from server
        <script type="text/javascript" src="./products.js"></script>
